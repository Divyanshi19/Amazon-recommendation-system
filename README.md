# Amazon-recommendation-system
In this project, we are trying to develop a model so that we can easily search according to our needs. This model is used to provide most relevant and accurate items to the user by filtering stuff from a huge pool. In this I have used various methods of recommendation like popularity based, classification base and collaborative based.
